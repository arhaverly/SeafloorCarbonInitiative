abstract = {In mineral beneficiation, grinding is the final stage in the process of size reduction. The power consumed in this stage is higher when compared to other stages, owing to increased size reduction ratio. The primary purpose of grinding is to reduce the particle size to optimum so that mineral particles can be extracted more economically. Decision making plays an important role here, as it involves determining and comparing the energy that is required to perform the grinding process and also determining the amount of minerals lost as the coarser size particles are arrived at in mineral beneficiation. In general, Bond's work index is used to determine the grinding efficiency and also to calculate the power requirement. The process is very time consuming and it requires skilled labor and specialized mill. A systematic investigation was carried out to predict Bond's work index using simple field measurable properties of rocks. Tests were conducted on Basalt, Slate and Granite using a laboratory scale ball mill and rock properties namely density, Protodyakonov's strength index and rebound hardness number were determined. The results were analyzed using artificial neural networks and regression analysis. Mathematical equations were developed to predict Bond's work index based on rock properties using regression analysis, which resulted a very good correlation co-efficient values.}

pages={242-248},
abstract={Enhanced silicate rock weathering (ERW), deployable with croplands, has potential use for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which is now necessary to mitigate anthropogenic climate change1. ERW also has possible co-benefits for improved food and soil security, and reduced ocean acidification2--4. Here we use an integrated performance modelling approach to make an initial techno-economic assessment for 2050, quantifying how CDR potential and costs vary among nations in relation to business-as-usual energy policies and policies consistent with limiting future warming to 2 degrees Celsius5. China, India, the USA and Brazil have great potential to help achieve average global CDR goals of 0.5 to 2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year with extraction costs of approximately US{\$}80--180 per tonne of CO2. These goals and costs are robust, regardless of future energy policies. Deployment within existing croplands offers opportunities to align agriculture and climate policy. However, success will depend upon overcoming political and social inertia to develop regulatory and incentive frameworks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of ERW deployment, including the potential for excess industrial silicate materials (basalt mine overburden, concrete, and iron and steel slag) to obviate the need for new mining, as well as uncertainties in soil weathering rates and land--ocean transfer of weathered products.},

abstract={Anthropogenic emissions alter atmospheric composition and therefore the climate, with implications for air pollution- and climate-related human health. Mortality attributable to air pollution and non-optimal temperature is a major concern, expected to shift under future climate change and socioeconomic scenarios. In this work, results from numerical simulations are used to assess future changes in mortality attributable to long-term exposure to both non-optimal temperature and air pollution simultaneously. Here we show that under a realistic scenario, end-of-century mortality could quadruple from present-day values to around 30 (95{\%} confidence level:12-53) million people/year. While pollution-related mortality is projected to increase five-fold, temperature-related mortality will experience a seven-fold rise, making it a more important health risk factor than air pollution for at least 20{\%} of the world's population. These findings highlight the urgent need to implement stronger climate policies to prevent future loss of life, outweighing the benefits of air quality improvements alone.},

Exploiting natural global temperature variability, we find that 1°C warming reduces world GDP by 12%. Global temperature correlates strongly with extreme climatic events, unlike country-level temperature used in previous work, explaining our larger estimate. We use this evidence to estimate damage functions in a neoclassical growth model. Business-as-usual warming implies a 25% present welfare loss and a Social Cost of Carbon of $1,367 per ton. These impacts suggest that unilateral decarbonization policy is cost-effective for large countries such as the United States.},
